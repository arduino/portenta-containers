## Factory Containers

This project allows you to optionally build containers for your Foundries
Factory. Based on the configuration of your factory's
`ci-scripts/factory-config.yml` definition these have the ability to be
multi-arch containers.

This project is a simple template to demonstrate what is possible. As long
as directories end with `.disabled`, then nothing will be built.
